Hiya there! I'm a student currently pursuing journalism. I code and do systems administration in my spare time, with experience in JS (Node and client-side), Rust, C#, and Python (along with other languages).

You can find my website [here](https://danny.works). If you'd like to hire my development/systems administration expertise, you can [go here](https://hydrabank.systems) for more information.
