# hi, i'm dani
when i'm not studying, i'm a web designer and software developer. i do a lot of stuff, feel free to look around at my older projects (and my org projects)!

i really don't use this for personal projects anymore - most of that's on my personal forgejo instance or on [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/daniaintonline). cool to see you here, though!

## experience

- **frontend js**: 3 years of experience w/ react (early 2021)
- **python**: 4 years of experience generally (early 2020) and 2 years of experience w/ PyTorch and TensorFlow (late 2021)
