## Hey there!

I'm Danny, a software engineer, UI and web designer, systems administrator, and data analyst. 

I have skills in JavaScript and TypeScript (Node, Deno, Electron, and client-side), Python, and Java. I'm learning C#, C++, Rust, and Go at the moment.

I am a Lead Developer at [Ice Cream Studios](https://discord.gg/XUPHpTrZdP). We develop the namesake bot Ice Cream. I also co-own [FibreDragon](https://fibredragon.com) with a friend of mine.

My personal projects include Discord bots, software, and systems administration. My main coding project at the moment is [Songfish](https://github.com/Dannnington/songfish), an invite-only Discord bot for music playback.

***My website has all my social medias and links. It can be found [here](https://bean.codes).***
